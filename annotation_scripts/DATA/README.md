# Data folder # <br />
<br /> 
This folder contains additional data needed in the annotation of near coding variants. The generation of all data is described in the 'methods' section of the manuscript. <br />
<br />
### Core PolyA motifs <br />
PolyA motifs within 30bp upstream of the primary polyA cleavage site <br />
<br />
### Human IRES info <br />
IRES locations from IRES base (Zhao et al 2020) <br />
<br />
### miRNA data - hglift_genome_146f2 file <br />
Micro RNA binding sites obtained from Plotnikova et al 2019; Nowakowski et al 2018; Spengler et al 2016; Bodreau et al 2014 <br />
<br />
### TFBS - plus code <br />
Transcription factor binding site locations from Vierstra et al 2020. This then needs to be passed to the FABIAN tool (steinhaus et al 2022), as per manuscript methods. <br />
